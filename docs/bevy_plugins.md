Two distinct questions there, and 0.19 is right at the edge of what I know reliably. Searching both.0.19.0 landed June 18, 2026 — after my cutoff, so let me read the actual docs rather than rely on memory.Now the second half — crate conventions. Bevy maintains official guidance on this.The canonical page moved. Let me read it in full.Two more things to pin down: the `plugin_group!` macro and Bevy's system-set naming convention.One more: `bevy_cli` has lints that mechanically enforce these conventions.One last check — I want to verify the idiomatic `lib.rs` header rather than assert it from memory.Full reference is in the file. The headlines, plus the parts that touch your existing CLAUDE.md:

**The plugin pattern shifted, and it's a real shift.** The 0.19 rustdoc now leads with "Most plugins are simply functions that add configuration to an `App`" — a bare `pub fn my_plugin(app: &mut App)`, backed by a blanket `impl<T: Fn(&mut App) + Send + Sync + 'static> Plugin for T`. Manual `impl Plugin` is documented as being for more advanced use cases. The trait itself is unchanged (`build` required; `ready`/`finish`/`cleanup`/`name`/`is_unique` provided), and the lifecycle is `build` immediately on add, then wait for all `ready` to return true, then all `finish`, then all `cleanup`. One useful detail for your facade-newtype habit: duplicate detection is by `name()`, whose default is the type name, so generic plugins with different type parameters are not considered duplicates.

**Two things in 0.19 that may invalidate documented traps in your file.** Both are worth re-verifying against your vendored source rather than taking from me:

- Your trap "All run conditions are evaluated — there is no short-circuit" describes a mechanism that changed underneath. In 0.19, `SystemParam::validate_param` and `System::validate_param` were removed, validation moved into `get_param` (which now returns a `Result`), and systems are no longer validated before running. Specifically for the parallel path: validation was previously a cheap pre-validation step done while checking run conditions; now tasks are spawned for systems that would fail or be skipped during validation. Your `Option<Res<T>>` fix is still right, but the "why" in your comment is now describing 0.18's implementation.
- Your animation section pins a GLB contract. The `AnimationTargetId` algorithm changed to fix a bug where different joint hierarchies could get the same id, and any serialized `AnimationTargetId` values need recalculating. Also `MorphPlugin` was removed.

**One addition for the traps list:** your `Resource`/`Component` note is correct but incomplete in a way that bites. Because resources are components now, broad queries — `Query<()>`, `Query<Entity>`, `Query<EntityMut>`, `Query<EntityRef>`, `Query<Option<&T>>` — can conflict with resource access, and the fix is a `Without<IsResource>` filter, since `IsResource` is attached to all resource entities. Worse for a determinism-sensitive codebase: inserting a copy of any `Resource` type even as a component despawns other copies of it on other entities, and `World::clear_entities` now also clears all resources. And for `emerge-core`'s `DetRng`: rand went to 0.10, where `RngCore` is now `Rng` and the old `Rng` is now `RngExt`.

**On crate conventions, three things you're not currently doing.** Your dual-license split already matches Bevy's recommendation exactly, and for the stated reason — Apache-2.0 significantly reduces license-compliance boilerplate in published games because only one copy of the license need be included, and it maximises compatibility with Bevy and Rust. What's missing:

1. **`#![doc = include_str!("../README.md")]`** in each crate's `lib.rs`. This is the header Bevy's own crates use, alongside `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` and the `html_logo_url` doc attr. It makes `crates/<name>/README.md` the crate's front-page docs — which, given `crates/<name>/` *is* your mirror root, collapses two documents into one. That's the same reference-don't-repeat lever from the last two turns, and here it's free.
2. **A Bevy compatibility table** in each README. Bevy calls this out as directly useful because some users stay on older Bevy versions. Your crates are `publish = false`, so the crates.io/docs.rs badges are moot — but the table isn't, and neither is the tracking badge.
3. **Explicit lists of exposed `SystemSet`s with their execution order, and exposed components.** This is Bevy's named documentation expectation, and it's the one most crates skip. For `bevy_stigmergy` and `bevy_light_grid`, where your CLAUDE.md already insists "caller owns the schedule," that list *is* the contract.

Two conventions you'd fail a lint on: system sets should end in `Systems` — Bevy standardised on the suffix and explicitly recommends ecosystem crates adopt it — and plugins in `Plugin`. Both are mechanically checked by `bevy_lint`'s `unconventional_naming`, though be warned: the release I could confirm (`lint-v0.6.0`, `nightly-2026-01-22`) supports Bevy 0.18, not 0.19, so check for a newer tag before wiring it into CI.
